# Data Fitness Assessment
*Mapping the Italian Climate Mindscape*  

---

## üí° Concept
Clustering requires data that is not only technically analyzable but also aligned with project objectives. Here we evaluate whether the **EIB Climate Survey 2024 (Italy subset)** is fit for the clustering objectives of identifying awareness profiles and supporting targeted communication strategies.

## Objective Mapping Table

| Clustering Objective | Available Features | Alignment (1‚Äì5) | Notes/Gaps |
|----------------------|--------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Segment by climate concern, preparedness, and responsibility | Likert-scale items on concern, responsibility attribution, and adaptation behaviors | 5 | Strong coverage; aggregated into composites already |
| Link awareness profiles to demographic/political traits | Age, gender, education, political preference | 4 | Good coverage; limited on socioeconomic factors (e.g., income) |
| Explore climate experience clusters | Heat events, flood experience, consequences indices | 4 | Captures self-reported experiences; lacks regional geolocation detail |
| Integrate solidarity/global responsibility attitudes | Items on solidarity and global action | 5 | Well represented in dataset |

## Coverage Analysis
- **Population representation**: The survey is designed to be nationally representative; however, response biases (e.g., overrepresentation of higher-educated groups) are possible.  
- **Geographic coverage**: No fine-grained regional identifiers available ‚Äî cannot map clusters to neighborhoods or provinces.  
- **Demographic subgroups**: Includes gender, age, education, political preference. Missing income and occupation variables limit socioeconomic nuance.  

---

## Quality Dashboard
- **Completeness**: Most survey items mandatory ‚Üí minimal missingness.  
- **Stability**: Single-year snapshot (2024). Cannot track temporal dynamics.  
- **Consistency**: Responses standardized through Likert scales; aggregation into 20 features improves interpretability.  
- **Potential issues**: Ordinal scaling assumes equal distance between categories; interpretation should account for this limitation.  

---

## Integration Assessment
- **Single-source dataset**: No need for complex joins.  
- **Composite construction**: Features aggregated into indices (e.g., preparedness, responsibility). Care must be taken to ensure weighting does not distort relationships.  
- **External validation**: Future iterations could integrate external datasets (e.g., regional climate exposure statistics) to enrich interpretation.

## Fitness Evaluation Checklist
‚úÖ **Feature Completeness**: Key drivers of awareness (concern, preparedness, responsibility, solidarity, event experience) are present.  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Sample Representativeness**: Broadly representative, but may underrepresent lower-educated or less engaged populations.  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Data Recency**: Current (2024), but only one year; lacks temporal trends.  
‚úÖ **Quality Indicators**: Minimal missingness, standardized responses, internally consistent.

## Capstone Connection
The EIB Climate Survey 2024 is broadly fit for clustering Italian climate awareness profiles. It provides strong coverage of attitudes, perceptions, and demographic correlates, though geographic precision and socioeconomic depth are limited. These gaps should be clearly communicated to stakeholders when presenting results to avoid overgeneralization.
