# Stakeholder Engagement Plan
*Mapping the Italian Climate Mindscape*  

---

## Concept
Clustering climate awareness in Italy generates insights that interest diverse stakeholders. However, each group may prioritize different outcomes â€” efficiency, equity, or innovation. This plan maps stakeholders, anticipates conflicts, and designs communication and trust-building strategies to maximize impact and alignment.

## Stakeholder Mapping

### Key Stakeholders
1. **Ministry of Environment and Energy Security** (high power, high interest).  
2. **Parliamentary Committee on Climate Policy** (high power, medium interest).  
3. **Italian NGOs (e.g., Legambiente, WWF Italy)** (medium power, high interest).  
4. **Educational institutions/universities** (medium power, high interest).  
5. **Municipal governments (e.g., Milan, Rome, Naples)** (high power, high interest).  
6. **Regional civil protection agencies** (medium power, medium interest).  
7. **Media outlets covering climate and sustainability** (low power, high interest).  
8. **Citizen advisory groups or local community associations** (medium power, high interest).  
9. **Private sector (energy companies, utilities)** (high power, medium interest).  
10. **Youth climate movements (e.g., Fridays for Future Italy)** (low power, high interest).  

### Power/Interest Matrix (Summary)
- **High Power + High Interest**: Ministry of Environment, Municipal governments.  
- **High Power + Medium Interest**: Parliament, private sector.  
- **Medium Power + High Interest**: NGOs, educational institutions, community groups.  
- **Low Power + High Interest**: Media, youth movements.  

### Priority Relationships

## Communication Planning

### Ministry of Environment
- **Key concerns**: Evidence-based policy design, cost-effectiveness, actionable recommendations.  
- **Format**: Policy briefs, technical presentations.  
- **Frequency**: At project milestones (midpoint + final).  

### Municipal Governments
- **Key concerns**: Local variation in awareness, targeted communication strategies.  
- **Format**: Regional workshops, visualization dashboards.  
- **Frequency**: Continuous dialogue; final results tailored to city contexts.  

### NGOs (Legambiente, WWF Italy)
- **Key concerns**: Relevance to outreach, equity in reaching underserved communities.  
- **Format**: Public-friendly presentations, infographics, narrative reports.  
- **Frequency**: At key findings release; invite feedback for interpretation.  

### Potential Conflicts
- **Efficiency vs. Equity**: Ministries may prioritize cost savings; NGOs push for equitable outreach.  
- **Policy vs. Activism**: Government may prefer incremental steps; youth movements demand stronger action.  
- **Local vs. National focus**: Municipal needs differ from national policy framing.

## Trust-Building Strategy
1. **Transparency Mechanisms**:  
   - Share methodology openly (documentation, assumptions).  
   - Publish evaluation metrics for cluster quality and relevance.  
   - Provide open-access visualizations for independent interpretation.  

2. **Stakeholder Input**:  
   - Midpoint review workshop for preliminary clusters with Ministry, NGOs, and community groups.  
   - Collect structured feedback before final interpretation.  

3. **Feedback Loops**:  
   - Post-release discussions to validate profiles.  
   - Update documentation with stakeholder responses.  
   - Maintain open channels for future collaboration.

## Capstone Connection
This plan ensures stakeholder voices guide both methodology and interpretation. By anticipating conflicting interests and embedding transparency, the project aims to produce insights that are not only technically sound but also socially legitimate and actionable.
