# Data-Method Alignment
*Mapping the Italian Climate Mindscape*  

---

## üí° Concept
This dataset is based on the 2024 EIB Climate Survey (Italy), reduced from 150+ Likert-style questions to **20 aggregated features** plus key demographics. The data is mostly ordinal (Likert), with some categorical variables (age, gender, political preference). Applying the data-method alignment framework means connecting these characteristics directly to clustering approaches suited to uncovering meaningful awareness profiles.

## Data Characteristics in This Project
- **Type**: Ordinal Likert responses aggregated into composite indices (e.g., concern, preparedness, responsibility), plus demographic/categorical features.  
- **Size/Dimensionality**: Moderate ‚Äî 20 features, manageable for most clustering families.  
- **Nature**: Attitudinal, perceptual, and demographic data.  
- **Preprocessing already applied**: Dimensionality reduction by aggregation, creation of composite variables, removal of redundant items.

## Data-Method Alignment for Climate Awareness

### High-Dimensional ‚Üí Aggregated Survey Features
- The original 150+ Likert questions reflected **high-dimensional survey data**, which risked sparseness and interpretability issues. Aggregating into 20 composites addressed this challenge.  
- **Method implication**: With reduced dimensionality, algorithms like **K-means** or **hierarchical (Ward‚Äôs)** become practical. Factor analysis or PCA can still be used for visualization and validation.  

### Mixed Data Types ‚Üí Ordinal + Demographics
- **Ordinal composites** (treated as scaled numerics) and **categorical demographics** (political preference, gender, age groups).  
- **Method implication**: For clustering, the main composites are central. Demographics are best reserved for post-hoc interpretation ‚Äî ensuring clusters are defined by climate attitudes, then profiled by demographics afterwards. If demographics are included directly, **Gower distance + hierarchical clustering** could be tested.  

### Moderate Dimensionality ‚Üí 20 Features
- With only 20 features, partitional and model-based methods are computationally efficient.  
- **Method implication**: **K-means/K-medoids** for interpretable centroids; **Gaussian Mixture Models** if overlap between groups is expected (e.g., people who are concerned yet disengaged).

## Recommended Approaches
1. **K-means / K-medoids** ‚Üí Clear centroid-based profiles of awareness and concern.  
2. **Hierarchical (Ward‚Äôs linkage)** ‚Üí Exploration of nested structures (e.g., splitting ‚Äúconcerned‚Äù groups into active vs. passive).  
3. **Gaussian Mixture Models** ‚Üí Capture overlapping identities (e.g., individuals partly skeptical yet showing solidarity traits).  
4. **Optional**: DBSCAN is less suitable here since data is not spatial and densities may not be distinct, but could flag small outlier groups (e.g., extreme skeptics).

## Preprocessing Challenges in This Project
- **Scaling**: Ordinal composites on different ranges need standardization.  
- **Balance**: Composite variables (averages/sums) may outweigh single demographics ‚Äî weighting strategy must be considered.  
- **Interpretability**: Ensuring clusters map back onto meaningful profiles for NGOs and policymakers.

## Interpretation Strategy for Climate Awareness Profiles
- Use **composite indicators** (concern, preparedness, responsibility, solidarity, event experience) as the backbone of each cluster.  
- Demographics (age, political preference, education) will describe clusters post-hoc, giving each profile context and outreach relevance.  
- Label clusters as interpretable archetypes (e.g., ‚ÄúConcerned but Passive,‚Äù ‚ÄúActive Advocates,‚Äù ‚ÄúSkeptical/Disengaged,‚Äù etc.).

The survey‚Äôs ordinal, composite-driven structure aligns best with **centroid-based and probabilistic clustering methods**, supported by hierarchical exploration. Documenting this alignment ensures every technical decision ‚Äî preprocessing, algorithm choice, evaluation ‚Äî stays tied to the project‚Äôs ultimate goal: mapping Italy‚Äôs climate mindscape to design more targeted communication and policy strategies.
