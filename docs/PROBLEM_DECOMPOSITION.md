# Problem Decomposition
*Mapping the Italian Climate Mindscape*  

---

## Ultimate Impact Goal
*Bridge the gap between climate concern and climate action in Italy, enabling more effective communication and policy responses.*

---

## Sub-Problems (5W Framework)

### Sub-problem 1: Public concern vs. personal responsibility
- **Who**: Italian citizens with varying demographics.  
- **What**: Levels of climate concern vs. perceptions of personal responsibility.  
- **Where**: Across Italy’s regions.  
- **When**: Current survey snapshot, possible generational differences.  
- **Why**: To understand why high concern doesn’t always translate into personal action.  

### Sub-problem 2: Engagement in adaptation behaviors
- **Who**: Individuals reporting experiences with extreme heat or floods.  
- **What**: Preparedness and adaptation behaviors.  
- **Where**: Regions most exposed to climate events.  
- **When**: Seasonal and event-driven patterns.  
- **Why**: To assess readiness and gaps in adaptation strategies.  

### Sub-problem 3: Perceived national vs. global responsibility
- **Who**: Citizens expressing views on government vs. international responsibility.  
- **What**: Attitudes toward domestic vs. global action.  
- **Where**: Nationwide.  
- **When**: Ongoing, linked to international climate discourse.  
- **Why**: To see how responsibility attribution affects willingness to act.  

### Sub-problem 4: Demographic and political correlates
- **Who**: Different political groups, age brackets, education levels.  
- **What**: Political preference, socio-demographic traits.  
- **Where**: Nationwide.  
- **When**: Captured in the 2024 survey.  
- **Why**: To explore socio-political drivers of awareness and action.  

### Sub-problem 5: Information trust and communication channels
- **Who**: Citizens consuming different media or information sources.  
- **What**: Levels of trust in science, government, NGOs, media.  
- **Where**: Nationwide.  
- **When**: Present survey responses.  
- **Why**: To assess how communication channels influence climate awareness.

## Feasibility/Impact Matrix

| Objective | Impact | Feasibility | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------------|-------|
| Awareness/responsibility segmentation | High | High | Core clustering objective |
| Adaptation behavior clustering | High | Medium | Requires careful feature engineering |
| Responsibility attribution clustering | Medium | High | Straightforward survey responses |
| Demographic/political segmentation | Medium | High | Easier but less novel |
| Communication trust segmentation | High | Low | Data availability limited |

---

## Selected Clustering Problems to Pursue
1. Segment Italian citizens by climate concern, personal responsibility, and preparedness behaviors.  
2. Explore demographic and political correlates of cluster membership.  
3. Examine perceptions of national vs. global responsibility as a secondary clustering lens.  

---

## SMART Objective (Top Priority)
- **Specific**: Segment Italian citizens by climate concern, responsibility attribution, and preparedness behaviors.  
- **Measurable**: Identify 4–6 distinct awareness clusters characterized by attitudes, beliefs, and preparedness.  
- **Achievable**: Use EIB Climate Survey (2024) Italy subset; Likert-scale responses are ready for preprocessing and clustering.  
- **Relevant**: Insights support policymakers, NGOs, and educators in designing tailored outreach strategies.  
- **Time-bound**: Complete segmentation and deliver findings within the master’s capstone timeframe.
